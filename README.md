### Info

 **_Feel free to skid this into your client if you wish. However I would appreciate it if you credit me in the file or in the project._**

This is the TickShift exploit. It is an exploit that works on almost all Minecraft servers.

The way it works is by increasing the client-side tick speed of the player for a certain amount of time, usually small, then setting the client tick speed back to normal. Think of it almost like a speed boost for a few moments.

However, there are some disadvantages to using it. When you speed up the tick speed of the client, you are sending more packets at a faster rate. This can cause the anti-cheat of the server to rubberband or flag you if not done right. This means you can only turn this module on about every 6-ish seconds without getting rubberbanded. Of course the amount to wait will change depending on your settings.

### History

The tick shift exploit was originally in a client called Future. It was in the beta version of it. Future client is **not open source** which means you couldn't really dive into the code and look at it, instead, we had to recreate it.

### X-Planation

A little while ago noatmc, Codex, and Doogie13 made a recreation of it. Credits to them for providing the original idea on how to exploit works. However, I, HausemasterIssue decided to step in and completley rewrite the exploit by myself.

Now, it works much better and is exactly what I dreamed it would be. Of course I'm not saying my code is perfect. In fact, my code is still missing a bit of functionality and things, and I will work on improving it. I _strongly_ encourage you to expand upon my code and this exploit as much as you like.
